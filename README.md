**Name:** Statistical Analysis of Image Deblurring Methods Performance Across Classical and AI-Based Approaches  

In the field of image processing, the degradation of image quality due to various types of distorions poses significant challenges for both human interpretation and machine learning applications. This project aims to systematically investigate blur image distortions by statistically analyzing relationships between parameters of the blurred images and metrics of the deblurring methods, both classical and AI-based.
