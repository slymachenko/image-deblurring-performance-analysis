    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of image processing, the degradation of image quality due to various types of distorions poses significant challenges for both human interpretation and machine learning applications. This project aims to systematically investigate blur image distortions by statistically analyzing relationships between parameters of the blurred images and metrics of the deblurring methods, both classical and AI-based. We will build the dataset by evaluating multiple AI models alongside classical deblurring methods applying various blur types to the real-world image datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results will be analyzed statistically to identify the most effective deblurring method and to understand the relationship between blur types, image parameters, and method performance. This analysis will provide insights into the robustness of deblurring algorithms and All code and the dataset generated during this project will be open-sourced to foster further research and development in the field of image restoration."
